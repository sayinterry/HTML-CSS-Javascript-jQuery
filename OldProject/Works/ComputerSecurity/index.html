Spear Phishing

How much do you know about internet security? Are you secure? Recently, there have been many attempts at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">spear phishing</a>; the version of phishing at which the hacker targets a certain group or person in order to get their personal and private information. A phisher is a person that sends "bait" in order to lure a target in giving information, usually in a form of an e-mail under a fake name or a website that is named similarly to the intended site. Spear phishing uses similar methods. Spear phishers will want to target certain organizations and specific people in order to receive their information. An example would be an e-mail sent to a high school student with the sender being named the high school student's personal counselor. That would be an attempt at personally targeting a specified target in order to receive their information.
