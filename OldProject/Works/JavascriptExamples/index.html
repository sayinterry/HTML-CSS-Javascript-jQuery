	On this page, there are a total of about 5 javascripts. For the first one, it asks for your name. After you input your name, it greets you. The 2nd example would be the alert that pops up after pressing ok. It is an example of the timeout function on javascript. It sends an alert after every 3 seconds. The 3rd example would be the moving box. It is set so that everytime you mouseover the "button", it will randomly set the top and left margins. This is done by having the javascript editing the stylesheet. The 4th example would be in the javascript coding itself. I am using if and If...else Statements. The last example would be the use of variables in my javascript coding.
