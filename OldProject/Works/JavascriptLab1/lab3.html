<H1> Lab Task 3 </H1>
<HR>
<P>
In this lab task, we are going to see how a computer program can make decisions. Depending on the word you type in the box, a different picture will appear. Type GOAT (or goat) and a goat will appear, type DOG (or dog) and a dog should appear. Type in anything else and a warning should pop up.
