	<h1>Yasu</h1> - Im the handset. I constantly sending a signal out to anywhere until i get confirmed that a tower is connected to me. </ br>
	<h2>Wilvin</h2> - Im the Tower. I check to see if any phones are in the area and record down their number and location and send this data to the office. I make sure to tell the office whenever a phone connects and disconnected from me. </ br>	
	<h4>Jansen</h4> - Im the central office. I wait to recieve and store data from the towers. </ br>
	<h1>Yasu</h1> - I feel like contacting my friend Terry. I'll broadcast my message to the tower I am connected to. <br>
	<h2>Wilvin</h2> - (to Yasu) I got your message. I'll send it over to the main office for analysis. </ br>
	<h4>Jansen</h4> - Ok tower, I see your message. I will check through the data for this phone number. Hmmm it uses the area code 415. I'll check where I store 415 info. I see it's near this tower. Let me send this message to this tower. I'll wait to see what he has to say. </ br>
	<h3>Terry</h3> - I see the message. Let me check if the phone is connected to me. Oh, I see the phone right there. I'll try to send the message. </ br>
	<h1>Yasu</h1> - Oh the tower im connected to is sending me something. I should check what it is. I have a message from this number. I'll check through my contacts and display it on my screen. I better save this in my memory. I'll tell the tower that I got the message. </ br>
	<h3>Terry</h3> - I see you got the message. Okay then I'll just tell the office the message was recieved. </ br>
	<h4>Jansen</h4> - Ok, the message was successful. I dont need this message stored anymore. </ br>
	<h3>Terry</h3> - And thats how our basic system works. Although, if a problem such as the phone dies before it receives the message.. </ br>
	</ br>
	<h3>Terry</h3> - Ok, ill check to see if this phone is connected. Hmm thats strange, I dont see it. I better tell the central office. </ br>
	<h4>Jansen</h4> - I see the message failed. I should store this for when we can find it again but for the sake of holding data, I'll erase it from my data after 30 days. </ br>
	<h3>Terry</h3> - And the central office will wait until a tower includes the phone number in their list of connected phones. </ br>
