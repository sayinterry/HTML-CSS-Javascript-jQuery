S2 Games is a small video game development company. Their goal is to create the next level of online gaming. Their first game, Savage, was widely liked for being one of the first of it's kind. Thus, a sequel was created called Savage 2. They started to integrate in-game stores and had the in-game stores sell items using currency bought with real money. Eventually, they released one of the new biggest hits, Heroes of Newerth. Heroes of Newerth was extremely popular during it's beta phase. This proved that the company had the ability to flourish into a great game development team.
