			<div id="tabs-1">Welcome to my home page of my website. Here, you can view the various works and assignments my teacher has assigned me as well as my own personal works (if I ever have free time in class). I hope to help any future A.O.I.T students complete their work and learn to use the following languages as I have learned : HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. As well as the knowledge of cross-browser compatibility, jQueryUI, and jQuery Plug-Ins. As time progresses, I will use this page to possibly create HTML 5 games using Javascript and jQuery. My total time spent on THIS current HTML page was about 3 hours total. It is mainly based on the jQueryUI functions: Tab and Dialog.<br />Additional Information: Works will steadily flow into my webpage, it is updated everytime I recieve a new assignment, and I wish to integrate a mobile version of this website.</div>
			<div id="tabs-2">This is my Image collage, the very first work I have done in HTML. It is a collection of images using the 'img' tag and having it link to outside sources. I remade this page so that it pre-loads the images using jQuery and loads them from a relative folder instead of off the internet.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-1" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-3">In this work, I created several different ways to link to other websites. Although, this is one of my crudely edited works and so it is my example on how much I have learned about web design.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-2" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-4">This is my first work I had practiced using CSS styling. I linked to an external CSS file and edited the style of my presentation on my interpretation of the text message protocol.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-3" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-5">For 6 different words, I created 10 <a id="no" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/connotation">connotations</a> for each. I also organized it in a clean fashion as to make the webpage look more appealing.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-4" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-6">This assignment was about putting all our knowledge about coding HTML pages and using CSS stylings to create a business profile for a company of our choice.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-5" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-7">Our assignment this time was about learning and teaching of a kind of computer threat. My topic that I chose was on Spear Phishing; read more about it on my html page.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-6" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-8">A non-required project that I coded using my limited knowledge of Javascript. I played around with the language and the product is my webpage. Please enjoy.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-7" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-9">Our class recieved an assignment to complete our first Javascript lab. We were given a folder with an a few files inside and had to fix each "lab" in order for the complete lab to function properly. Please view it as it may contain useful information for new Javascript coders.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-8" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-10">We recieved our first javascript challenge; we had to complete the Javascript codes so that everytime we pressed the button for image or text, it would create a new image or text that is attatched to the HTML DOM. With my spare time, I created a CSS style for this page and also added a random function onto the words so that a random word would pop up every time the text button was press.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-9" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-11">Hooray, one of the most fun add-on to Javascript. We got to learn about jQuery and made a page demonstrating use of jQuery functions and events. For this page, I spent too much time exploring the depths of jQuery and did not have enough time to make the page fancy.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-10" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-12">Immediately after learning jQuery, we were to create a design and web layout for a set of graphs that our teacher had for us. He wanted us to organize the graphs in  way that is most convenient to the viewer using jQuery. I had a lot of trouble on this particular assignment and could only get half of it complete. I was initially going to create 8 buttons that opened different sets of graphs organized by either the year it was taken, or by the type of results they were. I could only complete the buttons which opened showed the graphs by years.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-11" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-13">Reverting to Javascript, we had to edit a code that our teacher had given us and had to make the image inside the HTML swap with a different image whenever a mouse rolls over the image. I took a short time as this was fairly simple.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-12" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-14">Pre-loading a swap image took almost 3 times as long as it did for my image swap assignment using Javascript. I was to use jQuery and pre-load the images yet I had too much trouble on the correct way to append the image onto the DOM after being swapped. Thus I feel as though my solution could be cleaner; yet I am still satisfied with my results.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-13" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-15">We learned about plug-ins with jQuery. We practiced using the GChart plug-in by <a id="no" href="http://google.com/">Google</a> and created a chart that used data that we inputted into arrays.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-14" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-16">Our teacher found some tags that were VERY RARELY used and so he had us use the TD, TL, and TT tags to make a glossary. We used several words that he gave us and also included 2 of my own words.<p><a href="#" id="dialog_link-15" class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all">View?</a></p></div>
			<div id="tabs-17">Here are the <a id="no" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> projects I have made for the A.O.I.T class for the second semester. Please check out my <a id="no" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/sayinterry">projects</a>!
